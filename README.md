This document explains the specific C++ concepts and logic used in the provided example programs. The goal is to understand the "why" behind each piece of code.

1. Program: Positive/Negative Number Checker
This program demonstrates the most fundamental concept of decision-making in programming: conditional branching.

Core Concept: if-else if-else Ladder

The program needs to make a decision based on the value of the num variable. It can only be in one of three states: positive, negative, or zero.

if (num > 0): The program first checks if the number is greater than zero. If this condition is true, it executes the corresponding code block and ignores all subsequent else if and else blocks.

else if (num < 0): This check is only performed if the first if condition was false. It tests for the second possibility: the number being negative.

else: This is the "catch-all" or default case. If the number is not greater than zero and not less than zero, the only remaining possibility is that it is exactly zero. The else block executes without needing to check another condition.

2. Program: Student Grade Calculator
This program builds on conditional logic by introducing compound conditions and arithmetic operations.

Core Concepts:

Arithmetic Operations: The program first calculates the average of five marks. The expression (m1 + m2 + m3 + m4 + m5) / 5.0 uses addition and division. Dividing by 5.0 (a float) instead of 5 (an integer) is crucial to ensure the result is a floating-point number, which is necessary for accurate grade calculation.

Compound Conditions with && (AND): To determine a grade, the program must check if the average falls within a specific range. The && (AND) operator is perfect for this.

Example: The condition average <= 100 && average >= 90 is only true if both parts are true. The average must be less than or equal to 100 AND greater than or equal to 90. This precisely defines the range for an 'A+' grade.

Variable Assignment: Based on which condition is met, a string value (e.g., "A+", "B", etc.) is assigned to the grade variable. This variable stores the result of the decision-making process so it can be printed at the end.

3. Program: Coordinate Quadrant Finder
This program is an excellent example of using logical operators to handle multiple conditions for a single decision and the importance of handling edge cases.

Core Concepts:

Logical && (AND) for 2D Conditions: A point's quadrant depends on the signs of two variables (a and b). The && operator is essential here.

Example: if (a > 0 && b > 0) checks the condition for the first quadrant. Both the x-coordinate (a) and the y-coordinate (b) must be positive.

Mutually Exclusive if-else if Ladder: A coordinate point can only be in one quadrant at a time. The if-else if structure is perfect because as soon as one condition is found to be true, the program executes that block and skips the rest of the checks, making the code efficient.

Handling Edge Cases: What if the point isn't in a quadrant? The program correctly handles these special cases, or "edge cases," by checking them after all quadrant conditions have failed:

a == 0 && b == 0: Checks for the origin.

a == 0: Checks if the point lies on the Y-axis.

b == 0: Checks if the point lies on the X-axis.
The order of these checks is important to ensure the most specific case (the origin) is identified correctly.
